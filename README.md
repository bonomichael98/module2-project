## 01 Module Project 2

For this challenge I attempted to recreate a mockup using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The page that I developed is the baseline for my web developer resume.

## 02 Featured Content

I did not have enough web applications to showcase at this time so I used a placeholder image for each. Each image has an animation when the mouse hovers over it.

## 03 Contact Me

I was unable to get the contact me section to maintain the same width and proportions as the work section and I am unsure as to why.
